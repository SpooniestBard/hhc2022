We got you fam. You can use some santa magic to retrieve you key if you use the super secret santa magic terminal in a super secret location. 

on the left side of the main hall walk all the way back and then turn right to go behind the building and into the secret room with the lol floor and space turtle dude.

Next we head over to the closest KTM and click ```Approve a KringleCoin transfer``` to pre-approve our hat purchase.

We have our hat vendor's wallet address ```0xF845301A31Bc6fB367beCA5f402037d9a9574A15```, our wallet key, and we know the cost of our hat ```10 KC```...and if we forgot our wallet key we know where to find some "santa magic" to remember it (see FAQs section above).

Now that we have pre-approved our purchase at the KTM we can head over to the HATS vending machine to make our purchase!

We click the ```Approved a transaction? Know your Hat ID? Click here to buy``` button and fill out the form with our ```wallet address: 0xf22e94BeD2084C2F61874307D0449fd16b999C87``` and the ```Hat ID: 591```
