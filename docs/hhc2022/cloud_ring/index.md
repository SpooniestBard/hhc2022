# The Cloud Ring
![A giant steampunk machine inside of an enormous cavern](./assets/img/splash_art.png)

## Outline
Most of the challenges in the Cloud Ring are essentially guided lessons about using the AWS CLI and finding ways to use various IAM privileges to get a foothold in AWS cloud environments. The second challenge also introduces Trufflehog - a cool utility that can be used to find secrets that have accidentally been committed to version control systems. (schwoops!!)

## Challenges
* [AWS CLI Intro ★☆☆☆☆](./aws_cli_intro.md)
* [Trufflehog Search ★★☆☆☆](./trufflehog_search.md)
* [Exploitation via AWS CLI ★★★☆☆](./exploitation_aws_cli.md)
