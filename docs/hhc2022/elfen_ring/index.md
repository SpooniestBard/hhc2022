## Outline
The Elfen Ring is our second ring to find and it hides in a lovely water feature. All three of these challenges involve things that one could say are in the domain of systems admins and systems engineers and all involve some oopsies and misconfigurations that would cause a headache for either job title.

## Challenges

* [Clone with a Difference ★☆☆☆☆](./clone_with_a_difference.md)
* [Prison Escape ★★★☆☆](./prison_escape.md)
* [Jolly CI/CD ★★★★★](./jolly_cicd.md)
