# Holiday Hack Challenge 2022 Write-Up
![An AI-generated image of the North Pole](./assets/img/splash_art.png)

Here's our write-up of the Holiday Hack Challenge 2022. This is my second time attending Kringle Con, but Kim is a veteran at this point. We both very much enjoy doing these challenges together and look forward to hacking our way through them every year. Thanks to the SANS team for putting together such a unique training event. We figured this year that we would take on the hardest challenge of all, a six Christmas tree challenge if you will: actually writing the freaking report.

Most challenges have expandable sections which contain the answer to the challenge or a given part of the challenge on their header. You can click on each section to see a more detailed breakdown of how we arrived at the answers. Thanks for reading, and we hope you enjoy our report!
