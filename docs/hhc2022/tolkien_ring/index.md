## Outline
The Tolkien Ring is our first stop in our descent into the North Pole Subterranean Labyrinth. Two of the challenges involve a piece of malware called [Dridex](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa19-339a). The objective of this malware is to steal banking credentials and then use them to perform fraudulent financial transactions. All three of the challenges involve a flavor of blue team activities, both in detecting and performing forensic analysis after an attack has occurred.
