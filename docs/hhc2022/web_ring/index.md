## Outline
The Web Ring challenges bring us in close contact with web traffic and are split pretty evenly between staring at Wireshark until your eyes glaze over and staring at Burp until your eyes glaze over. Notably, the Boria Mine Door is an extremely creative challenge that we had a lot of fun with.
